## 3.1 About Ball Valve
A ball valve is a flow control device which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting
ball to control fluid flowing through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line
with the flow inlet and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle,
blocking the flow. 
The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open,
and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual confirmation
of the valve's status. The shut position 1/4 turn could be in either clockwise
or counter-clockwise direction.
## 3.2 Ball valve parts and working principle
The following illustration gives an overview of the ball valve.

The valve stem (1) is connected to the ball (4). The ball is supported and sealed
by the ball valve seat (5). and there are o-rings (2) around the valve stem for
smooth operation. All parts are included in the valve housing (3). The ball has
a bore through it. When the valve stem is turned a quarter-turn the bore is either
open to the flow allowing media to flow through or closed to prevent media flow.
